# Prerequisites

- By default you will probably be denied access to the serial port at `/dev/ttyACM0`.

    This issue is related to the permissions on `/dev/ttyACM0`:

    ```
    $ ll /dev/ttyACM0
    crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 0 f√©vr. 11  2016 /dev/ttyACM0
    ```

    This issue can be permanently solved by adding yourself to the `dialout` group with:

    ```
    sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
    ```

    You will have to logout and log back in before the group change is recognized.

- Install Python package with `sudo -H pip install pyserial==3.4`
